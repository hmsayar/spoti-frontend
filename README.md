# Spotify Frontend Clone

A React-based frontend clone of Spotify, replicating most of its features and utilizing the Spotify API and Web Playback SDK.

## Motivation

The primary motivation behind this project was to learn React.js by implementing a complex, real-world application. Additionally, it provided experience in using related libraries like react-router-dom and axios.

## Live Demo

You can try the live demo here: https://spoti-frontend.onrender.com/
For access to authenticated features, please send me an email so I can add your user information to the project.

## Upcoming Version

Currently, I am working on an updated version of the project, utilizing Next.js 13 with app router.


## Installation and Setup

1. Set up the [Spotify Backend](https://github.com/hmsayar/spoti-backend.git) following the instructions in its README.

2. Clone the repository: https://github.com/hmsayar/spoti-frontend.git

3. Change to the project directory: cd spoti-frontend

4. Create a `.env.development` file in the root directory with the following variables:

    ```plaintext
    VITE_APP_BACK_URI = "http://localhost:4000"

5. Install dependencies: npm install

6. Start the development server: npm start

7. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`.

8. Ensure the backend server is running on `http://localhost:4000`

## Technologies Used

- React.js
- react-router-dom
- Vite
- Axios


## Note

While developing this project, my primary focus was on learning and exploring React.js, which led to implementing a wide range of features. As a result, some parts of the codebase may not be optimally implemented. I'm continually working on refining the codebase and improving my skills.
